                    <h2>Sarah Shah</h2>
                    <p>Celebrated my birthday with friends by doing Jewellery Making. It was a unique and enjoyable
                        experience. We laughed,
                        got
                        a bit messy, and created some amazing chains and earrings. The studio provided all the
                        materials, and the staff was
                        super accommodating. Will definitely come back for more group activities!"</p>

                    <p>Took my mom for a special Mother's Day treatâ€”candle making! The studio had a variety of scents to
                        choose from, and we
                        had a blast creating our own custom candles. The whole experience was relaxing, and the finished
                        candles turned out
                        beautifully. A perfect way to bond and create lasting memories with Mom.</p>

                    <p>Brought my kids for a glass painting session and we had a blast! The instructor was patient with
                        the little ones and
                        made sure everyone felt included. The studio had a wonderful family-friendly atmosphere. The
                        kids were so proud of their
                        masterpieces, and I appreciated the memorable family activity..</p>

                    <p>My husband and I had a fantastic time at the oil painting workshop. The staff was friendly and
                        helpful, guiding us
                        through the process. It was a great way to spend quality time together and unleash our creative
                        sides. We even made
                        personalized mugs for each other. Highly recommend!</p>
